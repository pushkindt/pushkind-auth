**Build**
```bash
cargo build --verbose
```

**Run Tests**
```bash
cargo test --verbose
```

**Lint (Clippy)**
```bash
cargo clippy --tests -- -Dwarnings
```

**Format**
```bash
cargo fmt -- --check
```

## Code Architecture

This is a Rust Actix Web application.
The codebase is organized into several layers:

### Core Modules

- **`domain`** – Domain and DTO-level structs
- **`forms`** – HTML forms. Inner module structure mirrors `routes`
- **`models`** – Diesel representations of the domain structs
- **`repository`** – Traits and structs for data persistence
- **`routes`** – Actix routes, which are thin wrappers over services
- **`services`** – Core logic for handling routes. Inner module structure mirrors `routes`
- **`middleware`** – Actix middleware to handle cookie-based SSO authentication
- **`schema`** – Diesel‑autogenerated database schema definitions

### Key Development Rules

- Use idiomatic Rust everywhere
- Use `thiserror` for error definitions; avoid `anyhow::Result`
- Define error types inside their unit of fallibility
- Run `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo test` before all commits
- Document all public APIs and breaking changes
- Always run formatting and linting before create PRs
